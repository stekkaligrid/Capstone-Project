# Trello Backend API

This project is a backend API built with FastAPI for managing boards, sections, tickets, and team collaboration through invitation links. It was designed to simulate the core functionality of tools like Trello while following clean backend architecture principles.

The application uses JWT authentication, PostgreSQL for data storage, and a modular structure based on Routes → Services → Repositories.

## What This Project Can Do

* Register new users
* Secure user login with JWT tokens
* Create and manage boards
* Organize boards into sections
* Create, update, move, and delete tickets
* Invite other users to collaborate on boards
* Apply permission rules for owners and members
* Provide interactive API documentation with Swagger

# How to Run This Project Locally

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash id="x7p2lc"
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

---

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

### macOS / Linux

```bash id="p5n1tb"
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows

```bash id="u6r3mk"
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 3. Install Required Packages

```bash id="k9m4zx"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Create a PostgreSQL Database

Create a database locally. Example:

```text id="g2v7lc"
trello_db
```

---

## 5. Add Environment Variables

Create a file named:

```text id="r8p1qc"
.env
```

Then add:

```env id="t3m6zb"
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
ALGORITHM=HS256
TOKEN_EXPIRATION=60
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/trello_db
```

Example:

```env id="f1n7lc"
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:1234@localhost:5432/trello_db
```

---

## 6. Start the Server

```bash id="m2q7vk"
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Once running, the API will be available locally.

---

## 7. Open API Docs

Visit:

```text id="x4p8lc"
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Swagger UI allows you to test endpoints directly in the browser.

---

# Authentication Guide

1. Register a user using:

```text id="n7p2lc"
POST /register
```

2. Login using:

```text id="p4r8lk"
POST /login
```

3. Copy the JWT token returned by the login endpoint.

4. In Swagger Docs, click **Authorize**.

5. Paste:

```text id="g5r1tv"
Bearer your_token_here
```

You can now access protected routes.
